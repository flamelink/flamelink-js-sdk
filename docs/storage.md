# Storage

> All the methods that you need to work with the "Storage" Flamelink module is available on the `app.storage` namespace.

!> Note that in order to use the Storage functionality, you need to specify your `storageBucket` key when [instantiating the Flamelink app](/getting-started?id=creating-your-flamelink-app-instance) (or via the Firebase app if used to instantiate Flamelink)

---

## .upload()

To upload files to your Flamelink project and storage bucket.

You can upload files in any of the following formats: [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File), [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob), [byte arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) or from a String.

!> This method is one of the few that does not use a single options object as argument, so make sure you specify the correct arguments.

When using a String, you can use one of the following 4 string encoding types: raw string (default), `base64`, `base64url` or `data_url`.

_Upload a File or Blob:_

```javascript
const file = ... // get file from the File or Blob API

const fileObject = await app.storage.upload(file)

console.log('Upload success!', fileObject)
```

_Upload a Byte Array:_

```javascript
const bytes = new Uint8Array([
  0x48,
  0x65,
  0x6c,
  0x6c,
  0x6f,
  0x2c,
  0x20,
  0x77,
  0x6f,
  0x72,
  0x6c,
  0x64,
  0x21
])
const fileObject = await app.storage.upload(bytes)
console.log('Upload success!', fileObject)
```

_Upload a String:_

```javascript
const string = 'This is a raw string of text to upload.'
const fileObject = await app.storage.upload(string)
console.log('Upload success!', fileObject)
```

?> It is important to note that this method will set the file's `id` as well as the `createdBy` and `createdDate` metadata for you.

### Option properties

| Type                                  | Property   | Required | Description                                       |
|---------------------------------------|------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `{File / Blob / Uint8Array / String}` | `fileData` | required | The file content to upload to the storage bucket. |
| `{object}`                            | `options`  | optional | Additional options                                |

See the [API overview](/api-overview?id=fields) for details regarding some of these options.

#### Available Options

The following options can be specified when uploading a file:

##### `{string}` Type

- `stringEncoding` **{String}** - The encoding used to encode the given string.

_Example_

Upload a `base64` encoded string.

```javascript
const string = '5b6p5Y+344GX44G+44GX44Gf77yB44GK44KB44Gn44Go44GG77yB'
app.storage.upload(string, {
  stringEncoding: 'base64'
})
```

Upload a `base64url` encoded string.

```javascript
const string = '5b6p5Y-344GX44G-44GX44Gf77yB44GK44KB44Gn44Go44GG77yB'
app.storage.upload(string, {
  stringEncoding: 'base64url'
})
```

Upload a `data_url` encoded string.

```javascript
const string =
  'data:text/plain;base64,5b6p5Y+344GX44G+44GX44Gf77yB44GK44KB44Gn44Go44GG77yB'
app.storage.upload(string, {
  stringEncoding: 'data_url'
})
```

##### Metadata

- `metadata` **{Object}** - When uploading a file, you can specify optional metadata to be associated with the particular file

If not specified, Cloud Storage infers a lot of the metadata automatically for you, so in most cases, it should not be necessary to manually specify the metadata.

Take a look at the [full list](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/file-metadata#file_metadata_properties) of metadata properties that are allowed.

_Example_

To specify a custom `name` and `contentType` for your file.

```javascript
app.storage.upload(file, {
  metadata: {
    name: 'my-app-logo.png',
    contentType: 'image/jpeg'
  }
})
```

##### Folder ID

- `folderId` **{String}** - When uploading a file, you can specify the folder to which the file should be uploaded within the Firebase real-time db. (By default files will be uploaded to the "Root" folder)

_Example_

```javascript
app.storage.upload(file, {
  folderId: '1505670341980'
})
```

##### Folder Name

- `folderName` **{String}** - When uploading a file, you can specify the folder to which the file should be uploaded within the Firebase real-time db. (By default files will be uploaded to the "Root" folder)

This is a convenient alternative to the `folderId` option above, for when you know the folder's name, but not necessarily the ID it has in the database.

_Example_

```javascript
app.storage.upload(file, {
  folderName: 'Products'
})
```

##### Sizes

- `sizes` **{Array}** - When uploading a file, you can optionally specify the different image sizes that should be created for you.

Both the `width` and `height` properties are used as a maximum width or height, respectively. ie. Images won't be scaled up in width or height if they are already smaller than the specified pixel value.

The `quality` property can be any number between `0` and `1` and represents the quality in percentage. `0` being `0%` and `1` being `100%`.

> When this setting is not specified, the image sizes that are specified in the project "Settings" will be used. See [`app.settings.getImageSizes()`](settings?id=getimagesizes)

> When this setting is specified without `overwriteSizes`, the image sizes that are specified in the project "Settings" will be used in conjunction with the sizes specified.

_Example_

```javascript
app.storage.upload(file, {
  sizes: [
    {
      width: 240,
      height: 360,
      quality: 1
    },
    {
      width: 320,
      height: 480,
      quality: 0.8
    },
    {
      width: 640,
      height: 9999,
      quality: 1
    },
    {
      width: 800,
      height: 9999,
      quality: 1
    },
    {
      width: 1024,
      height: 2400,
      quality: 0.75
    },
    {
      width: 2300,
      height: 9999,
      quality: 1
    }
  ]
})
```

!> Since the Flamelink CMS uses a **240px** wide image as preview image, this method will always generate that image regardless of whether it is specified or not.

##### Overwrite Sizes

- `overwriteSizes` **{Boolean}** - When uploading a file, you can omit creating the default sizes defined in the project "Settings" area.

> When this setting is not specified, the image sizes that are specified in the project "Settings" will be used in conjunction with the sizes specified.

_Example_

```javascript
app.storage.upload(file, {
  overwriteSizes: true,
  sizes: [
    {
      width: 80,
      height: 9999,
      quality: 1
    }
  ]
})
```

!> Since the Flamelink CMS uses a **240px** wide image as preview image, this method will always generate that image regardless of whether it is specified or not.

### Progress Events

This method returns a custom object, a `PromiseEmitter` that behaves both like a `Promise` as well as an `EventEmitter`, so that you can listen to events during the upload process.

The following example logs out all events as they occur during the upload process:

```javascript
const file = ... // get file from the File or Blob API
const promiseEmitter = app.storage.upload(file)

const unsubscribe = promiseEmitter.on(app.storage.UploadEvents.ALL, (...args) => console.log(args))

const fileObject = await promiseEmitter

unsubscribe()
```

> Take a look at the `app.storage.UploadEvents` object to see all the possible events that you can listen to. Not all events are always available in all environments.

```json
{
  "ALL": "*",
  "START": "upload_start",
  "SUCCESS": "upload_success",
  "FAILURE": "upload_failure",
  "DB_PERSIST_STARTED": "file_db_persist_started",
  "DB_PERSIST_FINISHED": "file_db_persist_finished",
  "MAIN_FILE_UPLOAD_STARTED": "main_file_upload_started",
  "MAIN_FILE_UPLOAD_FINISHED": "main_file_upload_finished",
  "SIZED_FILES_UPLOAD_STARTED": "sized_files_upload_started",
  "SIZED_FILES_UPLOAD_FINISHED": "sized_files_upload_finished",
  "SIZED_FILE_UPLOAD_STARTED": "sized_file_upload_started",
  "SIZED_FILE_UPLOAD_FINISHED": "sized_file_upload_finished",
  "RESIZE_IMAGE_STARTED": "resize_image_start",
  "RESIZE_IMAGE_FINISHED": "resize_image_finished",
  "MAIN_FILE_UPLOAD_STATE_CHANGED": "main_file_upload_state_changed",
  "SIZED_FILE_UPLOAD_STATE_CHANGED": "sized_file_upload_state_changed"
}
```

### Return value

A `PromiseEmitter` that resolves to the newly uploaded database file object.

  folderId: '1505670341980'
})
```

*To retrieve all the files for a specific folder given the Folder Name. (By default all files will be returned)*

This is a convenient alternative to the `folderId` option above, for when you know the folder's name, but not necessarily the ID it has in the database.

```javascript
app.storage.getFiles({
  folderName: 'Products'
})
```

*To retrieve all the files for a specific media type*

```javascript
app.storage.getFiles({ mediaType: 'images' })
```

### Return value

A `Promise` that resolves to the `{Array}` of folder objects on success or will reject with an error if the request fails.

```javascript
app.storage.getFile({
  fileId: '1505670341980',
  fields: ['id', 'file', 'type']
})
```

### Return value

A `Promise` that resolves to the file `{Object}` on success or will reject with an error if the request fails.

---

## .getURL()

A convenience method to quickly retrieve the URL of a single file.

```javascript
const url = await app.storage.getURL({ fileId: '1505670341980' })
console.log('File URL:', url)
```

### Option properties

This method has one required parameter, which is the file ID and also an optional `options` argument.

| Type       | Property | Required | Description                                              |
|------------|----------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|

#### .getURL() examples

*To retrieve a sized image with a width of `1024`, height of `9999` and a quality of `75%` for the given file ID.*

?> If the given size exists for the particular image, it will be returned, otherwise the first available size bigger than the given size, ultimately falling back to the original image if nothing exists.

```javascript
app.storage.getURL({
  fileId: '1505670341980',
  size: {
    width: 1024,
    height: 9999,
    quality: 0.75
  }
})
```

To get the closest image size for your query, omit the `height` property as shown below.
In this instance the file returned will have a width if `1024` and not `1010` and a height of `9999` and quality of `75%`

```javascript
app.storage.getURL({
  fileId: '1505670341980',
  size: {
    width: 1010,
    quality: 0.75
  }
})
```

Alternatively, if you know what the sized path is for the image, you can specify that (you can find the sized path by looking in your Firebase Storage bucket under `flamelink > media > sized`:

```javascript
app.storage.getURL({
  fileId: '1505670341980',
  size: {
    path: '1024_9999_75'
  }
})
```

?> **HOT TIP:** Use `size: 'device'` to find a size closest to your device's viewport - only available when used from within a browser environment

### Return value

A `Promise` that resolves to the download URL `{String}` on success or will reject with an error if the request fails.
